#⚡⚡ Admin Dashboard Frontend⚡⚡

This is the frontend part of the Admin Dashboard application. It is built using React and leverages various libraries and tools to provide a robust and dynamic user interface for managing the application.

## Structure

The main components of the application are:

- `Components`: This directory contains all the React components used in the application. Each feature or functionality has its own subdirectory, such as `User`, `Role`, `Articles`, `CategoryArticles`, `Breeds`, `BreedsCategory`, and `Dashboard`.

- `context`: This directory contains the React context used for state management across the application.

- `public/images/logos`: This directory contains the logo images used in the application.

## Setup

To set up the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `admin/v1/dashboard` directory in your terminal.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the application by running `npm run dev`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5173/v1/dashboard` (or whatever port your application is configured to use).

The application includes various features such as user management, role management, article management, category management, and breed management. Each feature can be accessed via its respective route.
